# import resolution

This codebase relies on browser native import resolution. It also uses [importmap](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps#import-maps) to control import resolution.

As importmap are standard, browser supports them natively. This repository also configure ESLint and VSCode to use importmap for import resolution.

> At the time of writing this documentation, _importmap_ are supported only by chrome so files are transformed during the build to be compatible with other browsers.

importmap are used for [import aliases](#import-aliases) and [node module resolution](#node-module-resolution).

# import aliases

```js
import { add } from "../../src/add.js"
// can and should be written
import { add } from "my-alias/src/add.js"
```

Thanks to import aliases,import paths can be consistent: they always start from an alias and specify the file path from there:

- no `../../../` hell
- file can be moved without having to update import inside that file
- easy search and replace in the codebase

If you want to keep import aliases, check [How to use import aliases](#How-to-use-import-aliases). Otherwise see [How to remove import aliases](#How-to-remove-import-aliases).

## How to use import aliases

There is 2 import aliases preconfigured into [project.importmap](../../project.importmap). Feel free to update this file as you like but it is recommended to keep the number of import aliases to the strict minimum.

## How to remove import aliases

1. Replace all `"src/*"` paths with a relative notation: `"./*"` or `"../*"`
2. Same for paths starting with `"test/"`
3. Remove `"importmap"` field from [package.json](../../package.json#L24)
4. Remove [project.importmap](../../project.importmap)

# node module resolution

Thanks to node module resolution, some bare import are remapped to a real file location. For example, as long as `"lodash"` is in your _package.json_ `"dependencies"` or `"devDependencies"`, the following import:

```js
import "lodash"
```

is remapped to something like `"./node_modules/lodash/index.js"`.

If you want to keep node module resolution, check [How to use node module resolution](#How-to-use-node-module-resolution). Otherwise see [How to remove node module resolution](#How-to-remove-node-module-resolution).

# How to use node module resolution

An importmap file named _importmap.prod.importmap_ is generated by a script and contains mappings from _project.importmap_ AND the mappings necessary for node module resolution.
