# Deploying

Every push to `main` branch deploys the new version of the website at https://jsenv-pwa-template.herokuapp.com. This is done by Heroku.

# How to use Heroku

You need an Heroku account then allow Heroku to access your GitHub repository.

Check on Google or https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration for the details

# How to remove Heroku

1. Delete [app.json](../../app.json)
2. Delete [Procfile](../../Procfile)
