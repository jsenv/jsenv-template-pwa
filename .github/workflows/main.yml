# This is a GitHub workflow YAML file
# see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
#
# This file configures a GitHub workflow responsible to perform
# various checks related to the codebase. For every push to "main" branch
# or every push on a pull request, it
# - ensures there is no eslint error on files
# - ensures there is no test failing
# - uploads code coverage from tests to codecov
#
# If you want to update this file it's recommended to use
# a YAML validator such as https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml
# configured to validate this file with https://json.schemastore.org/github-workflow.json
