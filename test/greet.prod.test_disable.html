    <!--
    Disabled for now because we should create 3rd importmap for this use case
    and I'm not sure there is a use case for this.
    Test should test the code in development mode;
    Production mode should be strictly reserved to the code being executed after a build, from the build directory

    Why prod.importmap?

    - JS in this HTML page is testing the web application runned in "production mode"
      -> importmap must contain a mapping for "#env": "./env.prod.js"
    - JS can import code from files files located in node_modules/
      -> importmap must contain mappings for every "dependencies" in package.json
    - JS is test code so it can import code from "devDependencies" too
      -> importmap must contain mappings for every "devDependencies" in package.json
